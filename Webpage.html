          We all have an origin story. In some societies, they manifest as
          creation myths. In others, they look more like history textbooks. For
          example, as a kid in the United States, I grew up learning about the
          group of rebels who stood up to their British overlords and founded our
          country. <br> It’s human nature to be curious about where we come from, and
          origin stories unite people through a common history and shared sense of
          purpose. But what if all of humanity shared an origin story? What would
          that story look like? <br> <br> Historian David Christian tries to answer those
          questions in his new book Origin Story.
        </p>

        <p>English professors Dr. Alex Romagnoli and Dr. Gian S. Pagnucci, of Indiana University of Pennsylvania, discuss in their book Enter the Superheroes: American Values, Culture, and the Canon of Superhero Literature "the nature of superhero origin stories and how the writing of these origin stories helps make superhero narratives a unique literary genre."[2] For example, they write, "Superheroes get very complicated when it comes to their histories, but one part of their stories remains forever constant and important. Even more than 'death' stories, crossovers, event stories, and attire changes, origin stories are the core of superheroes' existences. Origins not only reflect the sociohistorical contexts in which heroes were created, but they also reflect a culture's understanding of what makes superheroes storytelling unique vehicles."[3] Thereafter, Romagnoli and Pagnucci go on to explain why the origin story is as important to the audience as to the generations of writers who continue heroic tales.<br><br>

          Dr. Randy Duncan (comics scholar and professor of communication, Henderson State University, Arkadelphia, Arkansas) and Dr. Matthew J. Smith (Department of Communication, Wittenberg University, Springfield, Ohio) use the origin story of Spider-Man as an example of how a character can be created by the persistence of a writer who has definite preferences in creating a character's personality, even if the publisher resists. "It is difficult to discern which is more often told: Spider-Man's origin or the tales told around that origin. All reveal fascinating aspects of a teenage loner fatefully 'bitten by a radioactive spider' to find himself with 'the proportionate strength and agility of an arachnid'." Duncan and Smith explain how Stan Lee butted heads with publisher Martin Goodman, who worried about an "ick factor," but Lee prevailed. "The entire Spider-Man concept resonates with the primary attributes of many genres and traditions," the authors say. "Like a heady puree of [Mary] Shelley's Frankenstein, Bob Kane's Batman, and Franz Kafka's Metamorphosis, Spider-Man's origin invokes gothic and crime fiction motifs like the ostracized genius, doomed loved ones, the misuse or misfiring of science, the gritty noir city, the driven vigilante, and the fateful 'return of the repressed'."[4] <br>The authors proceed to investigate these various issues of the origin story.</p>

          <p>There’s a story going around that eBay founder Pierre Omidyar came up with the idea for eBay because he wanted to help his girlfriend more easily buy, sell, and trade the classic Pez candy dispensers she liked to collect. The story continues to persist, but isn’t true; the narrative was manufactured by Mary Lou Song, an eBay employee who realized that the real story wasn’t clear, compelling, or resonating with early customers.<br><br>

            According to Adam Cohen’s book The Perfect Store: Inside eBay, the real story was that Omidyar had posted a broken laser pointer for sale online, saw it go for $14, and concluded there was an opportunity to create a profitable marketplace. There’s clearly a difference in the quality of the story: Omidyar as a sweet boyfriend helping to ensure the survival of an American classic toy really is a better story than a crafty businessman interested in making a buck on crappy merchandise. But the truth matters too. And in the end the reputations of Omidyar–and of eBay–are a bit grimier as a result of the lie.
            
            Answer tough questions.
            Many of us—businesses included—are sitting on stories we don’t think of as good stories; they’re just things that happened to us. No big deal.<br><br>
            
            Not true. Those things matter to your employees, customers, and the people you do business with. Your stories provide evidence of your character. Your stories illustrate what you say you’re all about.
            
            Thanks to years of experience in talking to individuals and families to craft memoirs, and business owners and stakeholders to get to the heart of brand and business stories, we can heartily recommend the practice of having someone else interview and record you to uncover and/or discover the stories you should share.<br><br>
            
            Give an interviewer the authority and responsibility to ask tough questions and record responses, and give yourself the authority and responsibility to answer truthfully, and vulnerably. In other words, if you’re looking for an authentic, interesting story, give yourself permission to go there. You’ll be rewarded.
